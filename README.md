Fortran code, realizing a spectral clustering algorithm for classification of chemical compounds based on their anti-cancer activity profiles

Brief Instructions:

1) Download the anti-cancer activity database file from the National Cancer Insitute website or by using the following direct link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHS9u2pnBPbpRu0JezWiZc7np0pBkMeG/view?usp=share_link

2) Compile the code (requires the IMSL math library).

3) Place the executable file in the same directory as the database file.
 
4) Run from the command line.
